# Hub

Hub is an object-oriented programming language for generating optimal distributed architectures for specific needs (computing, storage), and for evaluating the long-term performance of a distributed computing architecture. However, due to time constraints, we were content to design a language for describing distributed infrastructures. Our compiler takes as input a source code written in HUB and generates as output a visual rendering of the distributed infrastructure in svg format.
